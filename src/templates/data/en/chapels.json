   "p4": "The annual singing festival takes place alternately at the chapels in Altrincham and West Didsbury when the congregations get to grips with a selection of hymns old and new. Much practising takes place over the winter months under our local conductors Trefor Davies and Eflyn Evans to learn the new hymn tunes and polish the old ones. In 2016 the Gymanfa was held at Altrincham under the direction of Mrs Ilid Anne Jones, Glasinfryn, with Mrs Lilian Garrett at the organ. The Gymanfa in 2017, again with Mrs Jones and Mrs Garrett, will be at Oaker Avenue on Sunday, 14th May, 2.30 pm and 5.00 pm. For details, please contact Mrs Eflyn Evans, tel. 0161 445 9366.",
